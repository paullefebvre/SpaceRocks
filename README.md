# SpaceRocks

Space Rocks is a clone of Asteroids made with [Xojo](https://www.xojo.com).

This is an enhanced version of the Space Rocks game that is included with the Xojo examples.

Use the left/right arrow keys to spin the ship, the up arrow to active thrusters to move the ship and Command, Shift or Space to fire missiles.

Press "1" at any time to start a new game.

## 1.2.0, August 25, 2025
* Smaller ship to better match proportions of the rocks.
* Improved 'heartbeat' sound.
* High Score is saved and restored.
* Level increases as you clear all the rocks. This causes more rocks to appear at start and for them to move faster.
* Fire is now Command or Shift key.
* Press "1" to start a new game.

## Ideas for Future Versions

* Add UFO.
* Add special feature for down arrow (hyperspace or shields).
* High Score screen with names.
* 2-player game.
* After ship is destroyed wait until there is enough empty space before throwing it into the fray.
